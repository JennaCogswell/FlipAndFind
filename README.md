# Flip & Find


Flip and Find is an Android mobile app game that requires users to memorize a set of paired tiles, where one tile contains an image and the other tile contains a descriptive word. Users get a chance to memorize the tiles before they flip over, after which they are prompted to recall the locations of each word-image pair. If a user correctly matches a pair, the app provides an audio output to aid recall.

## Installation

Install Android Studio, open the project in the IDE and ensure an emulator is installed. Click run to begin the Flip and Find in the emulator.

## Usage

Category of images: Selecting animals, fruits or shapes will change the type of images shown on the grid.
Grid size: Allows grid sizes to change to augment difficulty.
Game mode: Lets users change the mode that their best score is recorded in. Best time saves the least amount of time taken to solve a game. Count flip saves the least amount of flips needed to solve a game. Practice doesn't record any score.

Muting the game's background music can be done from the Settings page.
